# Kernel Exploits

**Gathering System and Kernel Information**

To identify kernel-based vulnerabilities, first gather information about the operating system and Linux kernel version:

```bash
uname -r            # Kernel version
cat /etc/os-release # Distro version
```

**Searching for Exploits**

Use `searchsploit` to find local privilege escalation exploits that match the target system:

```bash
searchsploit <kernel_version> <distro_version> "Local Priv"
```

**Important Note:**

Compiling exploits **on the target system** is often more successful because the system libraries and dependencies are compatible with the exploit's requirements.
