# 🐲 OSCP Notes

This book is a collection of notes and tips that I have gathered during my studies for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (PEN-200) exam.\
\
It is designed to help me **understand** and **remember** the key concepts covered in the exam, and I plan to use it as my main cheat sheet during the test.\
\
The book is primarily intended for viewing on Gitbook, but feel free to fork it on GitHub and make any changes or additions you think would be helpful.

Ready to conquer OSCP! 🚀
