# Shadow Copy

**Shadow Copy** **A.K.A Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)** in Windows is a feature that creates backup snapshots of files or entire volumes while they are in use. \
Originally designed for quick backups and to enable file versioning in case of accidental deletion or data corruption.

Attackers often leverage this feature to access sensitive files, like the NTDS database, which contains user credentials, without alerting security systems.
